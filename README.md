## 📦 Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library
- **GSAP** - Advanced animations
- **Lucide React** - Icons
- **Web Speech API** - Text-to-speech (browser native, free)

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Enter Text** - Type or paste your text in the text area
2. **Select Voice** - Choose from available voices in the voice settings
3. **Adjust Settings** - Customize speed, pitch, and volume
4. **Play** - Click the play button to start speech
5. **Control** - Use pause/stop buttons to control playback
6. **Download** - Download the audio (browser limitations apply)
7. **History** - Access your previous generations from the history panel

## 🔧 Configuration

### Voice Settings
- **Voice** - Select from available system voices
- **Speed** - 0.5x to 2.0x (default: 1.0x)
- **Pitch** - 0.5 to 2.0 (default: 1.0)
- **Volume** - 0% to 100% (default: 100%)

### History
- History is saved in localStorage
- Maximum 50 items are stored
- History persists across browser sessions

## 📝 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Safari (macOS/iOS)
- ✅ Firefox
- ⚠️ Some older browsers may have limited voice support

## 🎨 Customization

### Dark Theme Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize the dark theme:
```js
colors: {
  dark: {
    bg: '#0a0a0a',
    surface: '#121212',
    card: '#1a1a1a',
    border: '#2a2a2a',
    accent: '#6366f1',
    // ... more colors
  }
}
```

### Animations
- Framer Motion animations: Edit component files
- GSAP animations: Modify `App.tsx` and component files

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Audio Download** - Web Speech API doesn't directly support audio recording. For production use, consider integrating a TTS API service (Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly, Azure TTS, etc.).

2. **Voice Quality** - Voice quality depends on browser and system voices.

3. **Long Texts** - Very long texts are split into chunks for processing.

4. **Browser Support** - Some browsers may have limited voice support.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] SSML support for advanced speech control
- [ ] Emotion/tone selection
- [ ] Text highlighting during playback
- [ ] Audio format selection (MP3, WAV, OGG)
- [ ] Voice cloning (requires API integration)
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Audio visualization
